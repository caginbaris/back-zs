TODO

# handle states & internal signals (maybe fault coding)

# current hb1 and hb3 should be replaced

#cau adc rank is changed after last ioc update for tim2

# variac test is not fully completed due to delawere lines resides for voltage levels

# relate stateFaults with faultWord and state decisions

#check voltage squence ...!!! (sym is not responding well for inversion)



for tomorrow

-check adc for currents (seq and scalng)
-adc timing(10khz)
-switching signals
